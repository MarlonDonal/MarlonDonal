<p>I am currently a Computer Engineering college student. I really like the feeling when I am designing UI for website. Mainly focusing on front-end web development, but also diving into back-end and UI design from time to time.

Currently, I keep my self learning JavaScript and PHP until I reach the average mastery of it before making a project that anyone can benefit from it üòÅ. I am planning to learn Java one day to make my own Minecraft plugins for my server.

So far, I have made the basic 4 basic functionality of server side (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) I learned a lot from this project. Feel free to suggest and report issues, repositories are open to contributions!</p>

<p>Build and maintain custom web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies</h3> </p>
